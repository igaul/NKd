A Rust crate consisting of roughly 500+ lines of code per student performing a coherent function. Can be a binary or library crate. Code should be written in a reasonable modular style, following coding standards and including internal unit tests, and should be managed using a Git repository. Project should include a writeup describing what was built, how it worked, what doesn't work, and what lessons were learned.
